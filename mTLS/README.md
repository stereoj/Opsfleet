#Demonstrate mTLS between two services on EKS using Istio

##Description
You have been asked to help a company improve its readiness for SOC2 compliance.
One of the tasks is to enabled mutual TLS between services running on AWS.
The CTO suggested installing Istio. Prepare a POC that does the following:
1. Installs Istio into an existing EKS cluster, use whatever method you think is best, but include the installation files or instructions in the POC repo (you can create the EKS cluster manually)
2. Add a readme that demonstrates how two deployments running on Kubernetes can be configured to communicate securely using Istio capabilities. Make sure you include a Helm chart that deploys the demonstration components so it will be easy to reproduce the POC scenario.
